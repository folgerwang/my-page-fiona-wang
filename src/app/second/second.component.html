		Violin <br />
    violin is my main instrument. I know how to play the piano, but not very
    good at it. I started playing the keyboard as my “study-music” instrument.
    Then I chose the violin as my main instrument. I have played the violin for
    5 years, I am commited to play more. I learned the piano along the way, I
    can also play the flute. Last year I was part of the Camerata orchestra at
    GSYO as the associate concertmaster and this year I moved up to Galbraith
    Honor strings as part of the first violins. I devote 2hrs of my Mondays
    going to rehearsal and practice throughout the week. My favorite instrument
    is still the violin though!

			Swimming<br />
    I swim for PASA (Palo Alto Stanford Aquatics) currently. I got selected once
    to swim for Zone 1 North in a Zone All-Star meet 1 year ago, at age 8. I
    started swimming at age 3 1/2, started competetive swimming at age 7 with
    TSM ( Team Santa Monica). I moved to PASA 2 years ago.
